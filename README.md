## FAQ

*I'm getting a strange error when I try to build*

Try deleting your chroots (normally in the `build/` directory) and building again.

*I can't delete my chroots! They say that something is busy!*

Just run `umount build/*/*` to unmount anything that's mounted. If that doesn't work, reboot your computer. The mounts should be gone after that. Then you can delete the chroots.
